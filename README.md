It is an Android application, using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), that stores business cards in a database.
The user can take a photo of a card and the application automatically fills in the fields with the data from the conversion of the photo to text.

# Server Side
I used [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to store the cards in a MySQL Database.
Server side files are stored in the [server_side](https://github.com/titosx/BusinessCardScanner/tree/master/server_side) folder.

- [Android Image Cropper](https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper) by [ArthurHub](https://github.com/ArthurHub) is used to trim the photo.
